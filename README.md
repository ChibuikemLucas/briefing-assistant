## 🛰️ Briefing Assistant

Briefing Assistant is a powerful Next.js web app that helps users upload, summarize, and manage operational or meeting briefings — built completely without external AI services.

All summaries are generated using custom text-parsing and logic-based algorithms designed by me, proving that intelligent automation doesn’t always need an AI API.

It also includes a 3D Summary Visualization for a futuristic way to view insights and connections.


## 🚀 Features

### Logic-Based Summarization (No AI)
Summaries are generated through a structured keyword analysis, text segmentation, and rule-based logic — no OpenAI or API calls involved.

### Document Upload System
Upload .docx files directly, with instant summarization and feedback.

### Briefing Management Dashboard
View, delete, and manage all uploaded briefings in one place.

### PDF Upload (In Progress)
Support for .pdf uploads is being integrated.

### Fully Responsive UI
Built with Tailwind CSS for smooth performance across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
